    <p> Hi, Iâ€™m Rahul ðŸ‘‹. I am passionate about creating modern and responsive websites

    some of my works â€” from interactive web pages to backend solutions. My goal is to

      <p>
    Iâ€™m Rahul, a web developer and Python enthusiast who enjoys turning ideas into 
    interactive digital experiences. I believe in writing clean, simple, and efficient 
    code that not only works but also teaches me something new with every project.

    Beyond coding, I love exploring creative designs, solving logical challenges, and 
    continuously improving my skills. My journey started with small web projects, and
